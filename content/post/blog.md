### It's alive!

  

So over the last year and a half, I have had this idea of maintaining a blog, but I never got to it. With the COVID-19 pandemic looming over our heads, I finally got to making one. 

It was rather confusing as to how I would go about it. I had earlier tried making one using WordPress but I never got really into it. Then I came across the concept of static site generators. I just picked Hugo as the tech I would use and start working on this blog.  



And well here we are. I'll keep working on the styling of this, but I think the current theme works for the right now.



### What is the blog about?

I don't really have a fixed idea of what I'd be writing about. But you can expect posts about music, projects that I am working on and my opinions on completely random stuff as well.

  

So I hope to see you sticking around!
