### It's alive!

So over the last year and a half, I have had this idea of maintaining a blog, but I never got to it. With the COVID-19 pandemic looming over our heads, I finally got to making one.

It was rather confusing as to how I would go about it. I had earlier tried making one using WordPress but I never got really into it. Then I came across the concept of static site generators. I just picked Hugo as the tech I would use and start working on this blog.

And well here we are. I'll keep working on the styling of this, but I think the current theme works for the right now.

### What is the blog about?

This is a free flowing blog. You'll find me post about topics such as music, projects that I am working on and my opinions on completely random stuff.

So I hope to see you sticking around!
