Hey there!

I am an MS in Computer Science student at Boston University. Previously, I worked as a Software Development Engineer at Mobile Premier League. I completed by BE in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology. I have a keen interest in working with different technologies. I have expertise in Go, Python, C++, JavaScript and TypeScript.

I am always looking for something challenging to take on, and if you feel like you have something for me, do reach out!
